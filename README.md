# F1/10 Autonomous Racing: Final Project

For our final project, we attempt to implement a Closed-loop RRT planner along with an MPC controller that will help in following the trajectory generated by a raceline optimizer.

## Milestone 2: Pure Pursuit!

The `gym_pp` folder contains code to run the pure pursuit algorithm in the gym environment.

## Milestone 3: RRT* with multiple tracks!

The `gym_rrt` folder contains the code to run the rrt* algorithm

## TODO
[x] Follow the gap with multiple tracks
[x] Implement prediction for opponent car
[] Incorporate prediction into follow the gap
[] Generate a high level path using Dubins curve for MPC to track (Backup: Use RRT*)
[] MPC
