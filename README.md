# F1/10 Autonomous Racing: Final Project

For our final project, we attempt to implement a Closed-loop RRT planner along with an MPC controller that will help in following the trajectory generated by a raceline optimizer.

## Milestone 2: Pure Pursuit!

The `gym_pp` folder contains code to run the pure pursuit algorithm in the gym environment.

## TODO
- Optimizer to generate the trajectory
- CL-RRT
- MPC
